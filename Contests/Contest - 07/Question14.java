    The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate span of stockâ€™s price for all N days. You are given an array of length N, where ith element of array denotes the price of a stock on ith. Find the span of stock's price on ith day, for every 1<=i<=N.

    A span of a stock's price on a given day, i, is the maximum number of consecutive days before the (i+1)th day, for which stock's price on these days is less than or equal to that on the ith day.

    Input Format - First line contains integer N denoting size of the array. Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
    Constraints - 1 <= N <= 10^6
    Output Format - Display the array containing stock span values.
    Sample Input - 
        5
        30
        35
        40
        38
        35
    Sample Output - 1 2 3 1 1 END
    Explanation - 
        For the given case
        for day1 stock span = 1
        for day2 stock span = 2 (as 35 > 30 so both days are included in it)
        for day3 stock span = 3 (as 40 > 35 so 2+1=3)
        for day4 stock span = 1 (as 38 < 40 so only that day is included)
        for day5 stock span = 1 (as 35 < 38 so only that day is included)
        hence output is 1 2 3 1 1 END
